(** Hash-consing utilities for value deduplication.

    This module provides hash-consing utilities (i.e., utilities to ensure that
    structurally equal values share the same memory representation). It consists
    of a general construction useful for recursive types (the type [t]) and then
    a simplified version for straightforward deduplication (the module [Dedup]).
*)

(** A hash-consed value of type ['a] associated with a table of type ['tbl].

    The ['tbl] phantom type parameter prevents accidentally mixing values from
    different hash-consing tables, which would break the invariant that physical
    equality implies structural equality. *)
type ('a, 'tbl) t

(** [hash e] returns the precomputed hash of [e]. O(1). *)
val hash : ('a, 'tbl) t -> int

(** [equal e1 e2] returns [true] iff [e1] and [e2] are the same hash-consed
    element. This is O(1) because it uses physical equality. *)
val equal : ('a, 'tbl) t -> ('a, 'tbl) t -> bool

(** [value e] returns the underlying value of [e]. *)
val value : ('a, 'tbl) t -> 'a

(** Functor to create a hash-consing table for a specific type.

    Each application of [Table] creates a fresh table with an incompatible [tbl]
    type, preventing values from different tables from being mixed. *)
module Table (H : sig
  type t

  (** Initial size for the internal hash table. *)
  val initial_size : int

  (** Structural hash function for values. *)
  val hash : t -> int

  (** Structural equality for values. *)
  val equal : t -> t -> bool
end) : sig
  (** Phantom type identifying this specific table. *)
  type tbl

  (** [create v] returns the canonical hash-consed element for [v]. If a
      structurally equal value already exists in the table, that element is
      returned. Otherwise, a new element is created and added to the table. *)
  val create : H.t -> (H.t, tbl) t
end

(** Simplified functor interface for hash-consing non-recursive types.

    This functor hides the table management and phantom type, providing a
    simpler interface. It is more cumbersome to use for recursive types, since
    the functor argument (including [hash] and [equal]) must be provided before
    the result type is available. Thus, for recursive types, use [Table]
    instead. *)

  type t

  val initial_size : int

  val hash : t -> int

  val equal : t -> t -> bool
end) : sig
  (** A deduplicated element wrapping a value of type [H.t]. *)
  type t

  (** [create v] returns the canonical element for [v]. *)
  val create : H.t -> t

  (** [hash e] returns the precomputed hash of [e]. O(1). *)
  val hash : t -> int

  (** [equal e1 e2] is O(1) physical equality. *)
  val equal : t -> t -> bool

  (** [value e] returns the underlying value. *)
  val value : t -> H.t
